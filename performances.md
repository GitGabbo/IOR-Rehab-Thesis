# Performances
For all the following tables:
* Accuracy Mean: it refers to the accuracy of the model trained by adjusting the frame number to the mean number of frames of all videos of that excercise
* Accuracy Max: it refers to the accuracy of the model trained by adjusting the frame number to the maximum number of frames of all videos of that excercise
* Accuracy Min: it refers to the accuracy of the model trained by adjusting the frame number to the minimum number of frames of all videos of that excercise
